This project was bootstrapped with [PIPENV --three](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/stargazers).

# React-Mobile-Responsive-Website
FlaskAPI-Bootstrap-Python-Blogging UI, while learning and practicing FLASK framework with hand on expertise in Python3, Javascript(few lines), HTML5 and CSS3, SQLITE3 DB ...... integration with responsive or client oriented repursion activities is to be added... 


### Python3 core 
### Bootstrap4
### CSS3 and HTML5
### Flask REST API
### SQLITE3 DB

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pipenv install --ignore-pipfile`

### OR

### `pipenv install -r requirements.txt`

The page will reload manually if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console while threading the Debug mode.

### `pipenv shell`

Before you lauch the Flask Rest Application, please ensure that if you want to use the application with fresh intialisation, then do delete the `blogger.db` and uncomment the below mentioned line scripts

### `lines 16-17, 20, 197, 241, 289`

Finally lauch the Flask Rest app

### `python app.py`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.


**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
